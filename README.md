This is a Web site I created for a Responsive Web design course of University of London on Coursera. The task was to create a gallery with a slider. I wanted to expand the task addng back and forward buttons and a description to every picture. 
Unfortunately, that messed with the counter and the slider skipps every second picture. 
The description is also not updated, if the the picture expands from the click on the thumbnail.
